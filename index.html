                    <h3>Quantifying Patterns: Missed Trash and Recycling Collection</h3>
                    <p>In this study, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the trash collection points
                         that were missed in the 8 wards of Washington D.C. 
                        This analysis covered a period of three months and utilized spatial analysis techniques. 
                        The findings of the study pinpointed the specific wards that required immediate attention 
                        due to missed trash collection, 
                        as well as the spatial relationships and patterns within the area.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>As a passionate Geospatial Analyst, I excel in transforming spatial data into actionable insights. 
                My expertise lies in leveraging tools like ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS StoryMaps and GEODA to analyze and
                visualize geographic data. One of my proudest achievements is contributing to a project that optimized 
                urban planning strategies, significantly reducing commute times in a major city center in Nigeria. 
                I thrive on solving intricate spatial problems and have a proven track record of delivering 
                high-impact solutions. My skills include advanced spatial analysis, data modeling, and the use 
                of Python for geospatial programming. I am specifically adept at creating interactive maps and 
                predictive models that support critical decision-making. My best qualities are my analytical mindset, 
                attention to detail, and a relentless drive for innovation in every project I undertake.
